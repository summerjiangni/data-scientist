The process of analyzing data typically moves through five iterative phases: - Identify the data you want to analyze - Collect the data - Clean the data in preparation for analysis - Analyze the data - Interpret the results of the analysis Gather data : Analysts often collect data themselves. This could include conducting surveys, tracking visitor characteristics on a company website, or buying datasets from data collection specialists. Clean data : Raw data might contain duplicates, errors, or outliers. Cleaning the data means maintaining the quality of data in a spreadsheet or through a programming language so that your interpretations won\u2019t be wrong or skewed. Model data : This entails creating and designing the structures of a database. You might choose what types of data to store and collect, establish how data categories are related to each other, and work through how the data actually appears. Interpret data : Interpreting data will involve finding patterns or trends in data that could answer the question at hand. Present : Communicating the results of your findings will be a key part of your job. You do this by putting together visualizations like charts and graphs, writing reports, and presenting information to interested parties.
